# ASE-Group-Project
## Project Description
  ### Motivation 🔥
> If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it. 
> If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it. 
> Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. 
> It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature. 
> When debugging, novices insert corrective code; experts remove defective code. 
> C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.
